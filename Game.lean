Title "Reasoning"
Introduction
"
This is a gamification of mathematical proofs. Every level has a `Goal`, which is what you are trying to prove. Closing the `Goal` means you have proved the theorem and there is nothing else to do.

You will use the `Lean` theorem prover, and its mathematical library `mathlib`.

# Right Side Pane
Let's explain what's going on in the right side pane.

This is where you can find the tactics, definitions, and theorems at your disposal which were introduced in previous levels.

Clicking on one will display an overview and some examples. This will be available to you at all times when working on the levels. Refer back to it whenever you need to.

Any new tactic, theorem, or definition introduced in a level will be highlighted in a yellow color.

We now discuss each section in the right side pane.
(note that you can view the official documentation of tactics or theorems by hovering over a term when you are in editor mode, you can enter editor mode by clicking the icon next to the hamburger menu that is in the top right hand corner)
## Tactics
In this puzzle game, you will use tactics to manipulate the `Goal` and close it, essentially proving the `Goal`. Tactics will be incrementally introduced, and tactics that haven't been introduced yet will have a lock icon which means you can't use them yet. 

## Definitions
The point of this game is not just to showcase ***Lean***, but also to learn some mathematics. Relevant definitions will be displayed here.

## Theorems
Here is listed theorems to use throughout the levels. Some you would have proved in previous levels and others are presented for you to use but without having proved them. An intuitive definition of why the theorem makes sense will be presented as well when it is introduced.

# Level Structure
Within every level, you have the `Objects`(if any), `Assumptions`(if any), and `Goal` for the current level. This is called the initial proof state. 

There will also be a text input to execute tactics accordingly.

***Lean*** tracks the proof state as you execute tactics and makes sure you made no mistakes.
You will execute tactics one by one until Lean tells you that you have closed the goal.

Info "
Many technical details have been skipped for the sake of not getting bogged down with `Lean` and its mathematical library `mathlib`, but focus on the aspects of reasoning and proof. You can visit https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/ for more information about any tactic used by searching `Mathlib.Tactic.tacticname`, and you can search for theorems used as well.

Zulip chat for lean has been a very useful resource to resolve issues when formalizing the exercises, you can visit it and ask questions in the '#new members' stream. You can also view messages without signing up. There are other streams dedicated to various topics you can check out as well.

# Editor Mode 
Some levels will force you to use editor mode. Editor mode is necessary for multiline tactics like `have`. Moreover, you should get used to it because it mimics a vscode `Lean` environment which is the most common way `Lean` is run.

To access editor mode, click on the icon next to the hamburger menu in the top right.

## vscode like environment
Hovering over things will give you the official documentation of things.

# Rules
You can relax the rules and skip levels.

This is not recommended for people who have never heard about Lean before. Moreover, relaxing the rules would ruin the coherence and structured/guided experience you would have when playing the game normally. If that is what you are looking for, then don't relax the rules.
