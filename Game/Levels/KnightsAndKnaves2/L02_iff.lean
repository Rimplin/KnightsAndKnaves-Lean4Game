Introduction

`A`: `C` is a knight or `B` is a knight.

`B`: `A` is a knight, if and only if `C` is a knight.

Everytime you need to assume, and for every bullet point, you would need to use the `have` tactic.

Notice that `¬A` means `¬C, ¬B` where ¬B gives that A and C dont have the same type. This is a contradiction of course so the proposition ¬A is not true which means that A is true.  

Now we know A, which gives C ∨ B
¬B means C, and it also means ¬(A ↔ C). But we know A ↔ C from A,C so we get a contradiction.

lets take cases for C ∨ B. Having C gives us (A ↔ C) which gives us B. So we get as a final answer, A ∧ B ∧ C. 
Having B, we get that (A ↔ C) which gives us C. The final answer is A ∧ B ∧ C.

Now we know A,B. From B we get that A ↔ C, which means C.

Now we know A,B,C.

We want to prove `A`, to do this we will prove `¬¬A` i.e `¬A → False`. The tactic `by_contra` facilitates this, assuming `¬A` and changing the goal to `False`.

Assuming `nA : ¬A`,
- Prove `nCnB : ¬C ∧ ¬B` from `stAn`
- Prove `AdiffC : ¬(A ↔ C)` from `stBn` , `nCnB.right : ¬B`
- Prove `AiffC : A ↔ C` from `iff_of_false (ha : ¬a) (hb : ¬b) : a ↔ b `, `nA:¬A` , `nCnB.left : ¬C`
- Prove `False` from `AdiffC : ¬(A ↔ C)`  `AiffC : (A ↔ C)`

  Prove the goal using `{hA}`, `{hB}` ,`h`.

  Use `constructor` tactic to split the goal in two, one would be proving the left side of `∧` and the other being the right side.

The proof of the second case for `h : B` is similar.
