Title "I am a knave"

Introduction 
"
Let's solve the previously mentioned 'I am a knave' puzzle.

Suppose we have an inhabitant `A` which says:
```
A : I am a knave.
```

We repeat the representation here.

Formally, the statement 'I am a knave' is `A ∈ Knave`.

Remember that if `A` were a knight, then `A`'s statement is true. As an implication:
```
A ∈ Knight → A ∈ Knave
```

If `A`'s statement were true, then `A` is telling the truth so `A` must be a knight. As an implication:
```
A ∈ Knave → A ∈ Knight
```

The two can be combined as
```
stA : A ∈ Knight ↔ A ∈ Knave
```

Similarly, if `A` were a knave then `A`'s statement is false. As an implication:
```
A ∈ Knave → ¬(A ∈ Knave)
```

If `A`'s statement were false `A` must be a knave. As an implication:
```
¬(A ∈ Knave) → (A ∈ Knave)
```

Both can be combined as:
```
stAn : A ∈ Knave ↔ ¬(A ∈ Knave)
```

If `A` were a knight (i.e telling the truth), then `A` would be a knave which is a contradiction.

Similarly if `A`  were a knave(i.e lying) then `A` would be a knight which is a contradiction.

Regardless of what `A` is, we fall into contradiction. The proof will take all cases for `A`, which are either the fact of always telling the truth(Knight) or always lying(Knave) and will show this contradiction.

Remember that `A` is either a knight or a knave, represented by `h1` , and our reasoning was taking every case and showing that we reach the same conclusion `False` in both. This is known as a proof by cases.

For this, we need the `cases` tactic. Try `cases h1` and see what happens.

  "Notice that `h1` is now replaced by `h_1`, and we have two goals to prove instead of one. 
  The difference between each is that in the first, A is a knight(`h_1 : A ∈ Knight`) and in the second A is a knave(`h_1 : A ∈ Knave`).

  "So now we have `h_1 : A ∈ Knight` and `{AKnave} : A ∈ Knave`. 

  But, remember that `Knight` and `Knave` are disjoint i.e have no common element , `h : Knight ∩ Knave = ∅`.

Conclusion
"
If you have heard about the liar's paradox before (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar_paradox), then this should look familiar.

A saying 'I am a knave' is like A saying 'I am a liar' or 'I am lying'.

In this level, we have proven the following theorem which is now available to you:
```
IamKnave (h : Knight ∩ Knave = ∅) (h1 : A ∈ Knight ∨ A ∈ Knave) (stA : A ∈ Knight ↔ A ∈ Knave) : False
```
