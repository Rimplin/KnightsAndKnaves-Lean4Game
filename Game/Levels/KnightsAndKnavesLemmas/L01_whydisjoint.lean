Title "`disjoint` theorem"

Introduction
"
Before diving into an actual knights and knaves puzzle, lets explore basic results implied by the assumptions of this puzzle.

We will first look at the assumption that no one can be a knight and a knave at the same time.
It is represented as:
```
h : Knight ∩ Knave = ∅ 
```

The reasoning in this level applies to any two finite sets, so we use the two sets `left`,`right`.

In our problem, we have:
```
Aleft: A ∈ left
Aright: A ∈ right
h : left ∩ right = ∅
```
This means that `A` belongs to both `left` and `right` i.e `A ∈ left ∩ right`.

So, we do have someone who is both a knight and a knave. 
This would contradict `h` giving us `False` which is the goal.

To show `A ∈ left ∩ right`, use the following
```
Finset.mem_inter : a ∈ s₁ ∩ s₂ ↔ a ∈ s₁ ∧ a ∈ s₂
```

Notice `have`, ... explain

Heres an example:
`have twoEqualstwo : 2=2 := rfl` will add an object named `twoEqualstwo` of type `2=2` to the proof state which would look as follows:
```
Assumptions:
twoEqualstwo : 2=2
```

You can choose any name after `have` and any type after `:`.

Given the following proof state:
```
Assumptions:
four_pos : 0 < 4
h : 4 * y = 16
```
`have yEqFour := Nat.mul_left_cancel four_pos h` will result in the following proof state:
```
Assumptions:
four_pos : 0 < 4
h : 4 * y = 16
yEqFour : y = 4
```

journey of formalization:
The two sets Knight and Knave must be disjoint. You can't tell the truth and lie at the same time because if that is true, then you would be asserting `p ∧ ¬p` which can be used to derive `False` i.e a contradiction.

The backward direction `Finset.mem_inter.mpr : a ∈ s₁ ∧ a ∈ s₂ → a ∈ s₁ ∩ s₂` is needed here.

    Hole exact Finset.mem_inter.mpr (And.intro Aleft Aright)
  Hint "
But,  `left ∩ right = ∅` so `A ∈ ∅` 

  We know that `left ∩ right = ∅`, so replace it with `∅` using `rw` getting `A ∈ ∅`.

`rw [h]` would apply on the goal, but we want it to apply at `{AinInter}`. And so `rw [h] at {AinInter}` will do.

  Hole
  rw [h] at AinInter
  Hint "
So now we have `A ∈ ∅` but the empty set is by defintion the set with no elements i.e `¬ (A ∈ ∅)` written as `A_not_in_empty : A ∉ ∅`. Therefore, `False`.
"
  Hint (hidden := true) " Remember `A ∉ ∅` is `A ∈ ∅ → False` , or use `contradiction`"
  contradiction


Conclusion
"
We have proved the following theorem which you can use in future levels:
```
theorem disjoint
(h : left ∩ right = ∅ )
(Aleft : A ∈ left)
(Aright : A ∈ right)
: False
```

Example:
For a goal `False`:
```
exact disjoint h Aleft Aright
```
would close the goal

The two assumptions `AinInter` and `AnotEmpty` are always true for any sets, and are available in Lean but where added explictly to this level for your convenience and to make things easier to explain. So, the `disjoint` theorem can just use them instead of having to take them as arguments.

The theorem `disjoint` can be used for any two disjoint sets, specifically the two sets `Knight`,`Knave`.
