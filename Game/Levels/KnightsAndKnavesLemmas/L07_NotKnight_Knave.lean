Title "If you're not a knight, then the only option left is a knave."

Introduction 
"
You are either a knight or a knave. If you are not a knight, then the only option left is being a knave.

In this level, we know:
```
A ∈ Knight ∨ A ∈ Knave
A ∉ Knight
```
and want to prove:
```
A ∈ Knave
```

In other words, we know that the left side of `∨` is not true and we want to prove the right side. This is a job for `notleft_right`.
"

/-

In our case, `P` is `A ∈ Knave`. Since we know `A ∉ Knight` then we can say that `A ∈ Knight = False`. Replacing this in the `∨` expression gives us `False ∨ A ∈ Knave`.

So we must have `A ∈ Knave`.
