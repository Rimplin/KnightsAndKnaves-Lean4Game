Title "Or, `∨`"

Introduction 
"
In this level, we introduce the `∨` logical connective read as 'or'.

Its truth table is as follows:
$
\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} 
\\hline
P & Q & P ∨ Q \\\\
\\hline
T & T & T \\\\
\\hline
T & F & T \\\\
\\hline
F & T & T \\\\
\\hline
F & F & F \\\\
\\hline
\\end{array}
$

From this truthtable, we conclude that to prove `P ∨ Q`,  we need either `P` being true or `Q` being true or both.

You can tell Lean which side of `∨` you want to prove by simply executing `left` or `right`.

In our case, we know the left side of `∨` is true, so use `left`.
