Title "And , `∧`"
Introduction
"
In this level, we introduce the `∧` logical connective (read as 'and').

Remember the following example:
Given the two propositions `x=2`(`P`), `y=6`(`Q`) , we can construct a new propositon `x=2 ∧ y=6`(`P ∧ Q`) which is read as `x=2 and y=6`(`P and Q`).

What is the truth value of this new proposition `x=2 ∧ y=6`(`P ∧ Q`)? 
Well, it would depend on truth value of the two component propositions `x=2`(`P`) ,`y=6`(`Q`).

What possibilities are there for each's truth value? `x=2` (`P`) can either be true or false and similarly for `y=6`(`Q`). Here is a truth table that goes through all these possibilities: 
`T` stands for true
`F` stands for false
$
\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} 
\\hline
x=2 & y=6 & x=2 ∧ y=6 \\\\
\\hline
T & T & T \\\\
\\hline
T & F & F \\\\
\\hline
F & T & F \\\\
\\hline
F & F & F \\\\
\\hline
\\end{array}
$


The proposition `x=2 ∧ y=6`(`P ∧ Q`) is true when `x=2`(`P`) is true AND `y=6`(`Q`) is true.
In other words, if `P` is true AND `Q` is true. This is how things work regardless of what `P` is, what `Q` is. The only thing that matters is their truth value.
Therefore, the more general truth table is the same:
$
\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} 
\\hline
P & Q & P ∧ Q \\\\
\\hline
T & T & T \\\\
\\hline
T & F & F \\\\
\\hline
F & T & F \\\\
\\hline
F & F & F \\\\
\\hline
\\end{array}
$

Notice that `P ∧ Q` is true when both `P` is true and `Q` is true, being false otherwise.

From this, we conclude that we can introduce `∧` if we have a proof of `P` and a proof of `Q`.
```
  And.intro  (left : P) (right : Q) : P ∧ Q
```

You can think of `And.intro` as a function that takes two inputs: a proof of `P`, a proof of `Q` and returns a proof of `P ∧ Q`.

For example:
```
And.intro arg1 arg2 
```
where `arg1 : P` , `arg2 : Q` , `(And.intro arg1 arg2) : P ∧ Q`. 

Use it to construct an object of type `P ∧ Q`, and use `exact` to close the goal.
